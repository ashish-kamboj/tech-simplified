Docker is a tool that allows you to package and run software applications in a self-contained environment called a "container".

Think of it like a virtual machine, but instead of creating a whole new operating system, Docker uses the existing operating system and only isolates the application and its dependencies. This makes it much more lightweight and efficient than traditional virtual machines.

Containers created with Docker can be easily shared and deployed on different systems, making it a popular choice for software developers and IT professionals who need to run applications across different environments.

Overall, Docker simplifies the process of packaging, deploying, and running applications in a consistent and reliable way.
