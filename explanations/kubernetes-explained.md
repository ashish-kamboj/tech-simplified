Kubernetes is a tool that helps manage and run software applications in a reliable way. It's like a traffic controller for applications - it makes sure that each application runs smoothly and efficiently, without crashing or slowing down other applications running on the same computer or server.

Kubernetes helps organize and balance the workload between different parts of an application, and it can automatically move an application to a different server if one server is too busy or goes down. It also helps make sure that applications can be easily updated and scaled up or down as needed.

Overall, Kubernetes helps ensure that applications are running efficiently, reliably, and at the scale needed to meet user demands.
