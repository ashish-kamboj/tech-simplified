Docker is a tool that allows you to create and run applications inside containers. Think of a container as a lightweight and portable package that includes everything your application needs to run, such as the code, dependencies, and runtime environment.

Docker Compose, on the other hand, is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container applications. It lets you define a set of services, each running in its own container, and specify how they should communicate with each other. This makes it easy to manage complex applications that require multiple containers, such as a web server, a database, and a cache.

In essence, Docker is for managing individual containers, while Docker Compose is for managing multiple containers that work together as a single application.
