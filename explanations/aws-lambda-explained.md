Imagine you have a big toy box with lots of toys, and you want to play with one specific toy. AWS Lambda is like having a toy box organizer who will quickly get you the toy you want to play with.

AWS Lambda is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps run computer programs without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. It's like having a magic box where you can put your code in and it will automatically run whenever certain events happen.

For example, imagine you have a program that takes a picture and applies a fun filter to it. With AWS Lambda, you can upload your code to AWS and tell it to run the program whenever someone takes a picture and saves it to a certain folder. You don't have to worry about setting up and managing servers to run the program, AWS will take care of it for you.

In simpler terms, AWS Lambda is like having a magical toy box organizer that will quickly get you the toy you want to play with, or a magical box that will automatically run your computer program whenever certain events happen.

AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run your code without having to worry about managing servers. It automatically runs your code when it’s needed and scales up or down depending on how much it’s being used. You only pay for the time your code is running.

Think of it like a chef who only comes to cook when you need them and leaves when you’re done eating. You don’t have to worry about buying ingredients or cleaning up, the chef takes care of everything. You only pay for the time the chef is cooking.
